Superluminal2
=============

Superluminal2 is a ship editor for the game FTL: Faster Than Light, and the expansion FTL: Advanced Edition.

It is a complete rewrite of, and successor to, the original editor ([Superluminal](https://github.com/kartoFlane/Superluminal)).

The project is still a work in progress and is not functional yet.
